## Outstanding: finish the pre-commit-checklists adoption

The adoption is built and verified but not yet merged. It is a stack of four
pull requests that must land in order, because each is based on the one below
it:

| PR                                                         | Branch                              | Contents                                                               | State                                 |

| [#13](https://github.com/ivan-pinatti/rsync-crypt/pull/13) | `docs/readme-lint-clean`            | 144 markdownlint findings to 0                                         | draft, no CI yet                      |
| [#15](https://github.com/ivan-pinatti/rsync-crypt/pull/15) | `style/shfmt-and-ruff-format`       | shfmt + ruff sweep, one real typo                                      | draft, no CI yet                      |
| [#16](https://github.com/ivan-pinatti/rsync-crypt/pull/16) | `chore/adopt-pre-commit-checklists` | the swap itself, pinned `v2.2.0`                                       | draft, no CI yet                      |

**The state to preserve:** on `#16` all 14 checklists pass, none of them
disabled or skipped. `pre-commit install` wires both the pre-commit and
commit-msg stages, and a real `git commit` with a non-conventional message was
confirmed rejected.

"Nothing ignored" would be the wrong claim, and was made in an earlier draft
of this file. Suppressions exist. Each is deliberate and documented where it
sits:

| Suppression                                       | Where                     | Why                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `superfluous-actions`                             | `.github/zizmor.yml`      | zizmor wants `gh release create` instead of a SHA-pinned action carrying `allowUpdates`, which has no equivalent. See item 3 below.                         |
| `MD001 MD013 MD033 MD041` and `MD013 MD033`       | two blocks in `README.md` | The centred badge header and the crypto QR table are raw HTML by necessity. Scoped `disable`/`enable` pairs naming specific rules, not a file-wide disable. |
| `--ignore-checks QuoteCharacter`                  | the local dotenv hook     | `.env.example` quotes its values deliberately; 16 findings otherwise.                                                                                       |
| `ignoreWords`                                     | `.cspell.json`            | Identifiers and third-party names, kept separate from the real dictionary `words`.                                                                          |
| `unset` properties                                | `.editorconfig`           | Each one is a place a tool reports something that cannot be fixed. See the file's own comments.                                                             |

`.secrets.baseline` is not on that list: it currently allowlists **zero**
findings, so it suppresses nothing today.

Neither the rows nor the sentence above them carry a count. An earlier version
said "Five suppressions", "38 `ignoreWords`" and "8 `unset` properties", and
every one of them was wrong within a few commits: each edit to those files
moves the number and nothing checks it. "Five" was ambiguous as well, since
the `README.md` row covers two separate blocks. What matters is which
suppressions exist and why, and that does not drift.

### Steps left

1. Merge `#12`, once its current head has been reviewed clean.
2. `#13` auto-retargets to `main`. **Wait for CI to run and pass first**,
   which only happens now that its base is `main`, fix anything it reports,
   and only then mark it ready so CodeRabbit reviews a diff the mechanical
   checks have already been through. Merge, then repeat for `#15`, then
   `#16`. Marking it ready before CI finishes inverts the whole point of
   `drafts: false`.
3. After `#16`, delete the `ci:` block's replacement worry: it is already gone
   from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, but confirm pre-commit.ci is still not
   installed on the repository.
4. Remaining docs pass: `README.md` still describes the old hook set and does
   not mention that local `pre-commit` runs now need Docker (for
   `hadolint-docker`, `actionlint-docker` and the dotenv image). `CLAUDE.md` is
   already updated.

### Two process traps found the hard way

Both cost a round trip; worth knowing before the next stacked change.

- **`pre-commit run --all-files` only sees tracked files.** A new file passes
  locally and fails in CI until it is `git add`ed. This bit the adoption twice.
- **CodeRabbit can stop reviewing without saying so**, through two separate
  mechanisms that are easy to confuse. The one that caused a twelve-hour
  stall here was `auto_pause_after_reviewed_commits`, whose default of 5
  pauses automatic reviews on a branch once five commits have been reviewed;
  that is config-fixable and is now set to 0. The other is running out of the
  plan's included-review allowance, which **drops** a review rather than
  queueing it, so a push arriving during exhaustion is declined and never
  retried; that one has no setting at all. Either way a review has to be
  re-requested by hand, with `@coderabbitai review`, or
  `@coderabbitai full review` when the incremental logic has already marked
  the commits as seen.
- **Every CodeRabbit signal is time-independent unless you check it
  yourself.** A green _check_ is green on a skipped draft and on a
  rate-limited decline. A _resolved thread_ only means a later commit changed
  those lines, not that the fix was read. A _clean verdict comment_ can
  predate the current head by hours. And a clean review creates no review
  object at all, only a comment, so "no review object" does not mean "not
  reviewed". The only reliable test is comparing the verdict's timestamp
  against the head commit's.

### Once `pre-commit-checklists` ships its own TODO items

Tracked in that repo's `docs/TODO.md`; two of them change things here.

- When `templates/.yamllint.yml` stops fighting the Prettier hook inside
  `checklist-yaml`, the 14 permanent `too few spaces before comment` warnings
  on this repo's YAML go away. They are warnings only, since the upstream
  yamllint hook does not pass `--strict`.
- When `.markdown-link-check.json` support lands
  ([#12 there](https://github.com/ivan-pinatti/pre-commit-checklists/pull/12)),
  no change is needed here. The stars badge was repointed at the repository
  rather than ignored, so this repo needs no ignore file at all.

## Deferred items from the adoption

Each was found during the adoption and deliberately left alone rather than
folded into it, with the reason recorded so the decision does not have to be
re-derived.

Nothing here is broken today. Items 1 and 2 are the ones with real
consequences.

### 1. The Dockerfile's `USER` is inert at run time

`Dockerfile` ends with `USER 1000`, and `id` inside the image confirms that
resolves to `uid=1000(crypt) gid=1000(crypt)`. But **all ten `docker run`
invocations in the Makefile pass `--user root`**, so nothing that ships here
ever runs as `crypt`. The `USER` line only affects someone running the image
directly.

That is worth a decision rather than a change: either the Makefile has a
reason to force root that should be written down, or some of those targets
could drop to the unprivileged user. gocryptfs needs `SYS_ADMIN` and
`/dev/fuse`, which is the likely reason, but "likely" is not a recorded
rationale.

Not touched during adoption because it is a behavioural change to the backup
and restore paths, and the lint work had no business making one.

### 2. Pull requests targeting a non-`main` branch run no CI at all

`.github/workflows/pull-request-validation.yml` triggers on:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
```

So a PR whose base is a feature branch runs neither the pre-commit job nor
the tests. This came up concretely during the adoption, which was a stack of
four PRs based on each other: three of them had **only** a CodeRabbit check
and no CI, and each only got a real run once it retargeted to `main` as the
one below it merged.

That is survivable but it forces strictly serial merging and makes a stacked
branch look greener than it is. Consider widening the trigger, for example:

```yaml
branches:
  - main
  - "chore/**"
  - "docs/**"
  - "fix/**"
  - "style/**"
```

### 3. `zizmor` flags the release action, and the finding is ignored

`.github/zizmor.yml` ignores `superfluous-actions` for `merge.yml`. zizmor
suggests replacing `ncipollo/release-action` with `gh release create` in a
script step, and **exits 11 on it even though the finding is informational**,
so it has to be either fixed or ignored; there is no "warn only" middle
ground reachable through `checklist-github-actions`.

Kept the action because it is pinned by SHA and carries `allowUpdates: true`,
which `gh release create` has no equivalent for: it errors on an existing tag
rather than updating it, so a faithful replacement needs a create-or-edit
fallback.

Worth doing on its own, where a mistake surfaces before the next release
rather than during it. If it is done, the ignore entry in
`.github/zizmor.yml` should go with it.

### 4. The Makefile is not linted, deliberately

This repo is Makefile-driven and its Makefile holds real logic, so the gap is
worth naming. Three tools were evaluated and all three were rejected:

- **checkmake** is wrong about this Makefile. It reported six
  `phonydeclared` findings (`r`, `ro`, `rr`, `rro`, `v`, `vr`) and a
  `minphony` for `clean`. **All seven are false**: every one of those targets
  is declared, on the `.PHONY` continuation lines. Isolated with a minimal
  fixture: an identical target set produces zero findings when `.PHONY` is on
  one line and a false finding when it uses a backslash continuation. Its
  `maxbodylength` default of 5 is also unusable on any real Makefile.
- **mbake** is a formatter, and reformats against this file's deliberate
  style: it collapses the aligned continuation indentation of the multi-line
  `docker run` blocks and the aligned `r:   restore` shorthands to a single
  tab. Exit 1 on the current file.
- **MegaLinter** has **no Make descriptor at all** across its 100+ linters,
  so "match what MegaLinter picks" and "lint nothing" are the same answer.

Revisit only if a Makefile linter appears that parses `.PHONY` continuations
correctly.

### 5. Files no hook covers

Minor, listed so it is a known set rather than a surprise.

| File                     | Why it is uncovered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CITATION.cff`           | YAML content, but `identify` tags it only `text`. Cannot be reached through `checklist-yaml`: `check-yaml` and `yamllint` both self-filter on `types: [yaml]`, so widening the id's own selector would not help. Needs its own hook entry if it matters. |
| `.secrets.baseline`      | Valid JSON with no extension, so untyped. Also deliberately in `.cspell.json`'s `ignorePaths`.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `tests/pytest.ini`       | Typed `ini`; no ini linter in the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `.tool-versions`         | Plain text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `conf/*.txt`, `llms.txt` | Plain text by design. Spell-checked (`conf/*.txt` deliberately not excluded), but not otherwise validated.                                                                                                                                               |

### 6. `CLAUDE.md` records a stale gocryptfs revision

**Status:** fixed by the Alpine 3.24 bump. The note now names `2.6.1-r5` on
Alpine 3.24, dated and with the command used to resolve it.

The open part of this item stands: the line names an exact revision, and it
will drift again on the next Alpine rebuild, because Alpine bumps the `-rN`
suffix without changing the upstream version. The `~=` constraint does not
care about `-rN`, so the note is the only thing that goes stale. Worth
deciding whether it should name a revision at all, or only the major and minor
that the constraint actually pins. The `-bs` flag warning underneath it is not
version-specific and was re-verified against 2.6.1.

### 7. Restore and view sessions write to a predictable shared path

**Status:** open. Raised by CodeRabbit on the formatting pull request, against
pre-existing code.

`scripts/restore.sh` and `scripts/view.sh` write their session files, including
`sshd_config` and host keys, to a fixed location rather than a private
directory. A `mktemp -d` per run, with every reference routed through it and an
exit trap to remove it, would stop one session colliding with another and stop
the material sitting somewhere predictable.

Not folded into the rsync exit-status fix: that change is about a retry loop
and carries a regression test aimed at it, and mixing a temp-directory rework
into it would make both harder to review.

### 8. `tests/conftest.py` invokes `docker` by bare name

**Status:** fixed. A module-level `DOCKER = shutil.which("docker")` is
resolved once at import time, and every call site (`docker_rm`,
`require_docker`, and each `subprocess`/`run` invocation building or
inspecting a container) reuses that resolved path instead of the literal
string `docker`.

Every Docker call passed the literal string `docker` to `subprocess.run`, so
resolution depended on whatever `PATH` the suite inherited. Resolving it once
with `shutil.which` (the suite already imports `shutil` for its
`require_docker` check) and reusing that path removes the ambiguity.

Low priority because the suite already refuses to run when `shutil.which`
cannot find Docker, so the realistic failure is a surprising binary rather
than a missing one.

### 9. `GOCRYPTFS_CIPHER` had one value that did nothing and one that could not work

**Status:** fixed. `aes-gcm` and `aes-siv` are now accepted as equivalent
spellings and both pass `-aessiv` explicitly, `xchacha` is refused with a
message explaining that reverse mode implies AES-SIV, and anything else
aborts rather than silently falling back. `tests/test_gocryptfs_cipher.py`
executes the real `case` block to check each path.

Found while re-resolving pins for the Alpine 3.24 bump. `backup.sh` accepted
three values and mapped them to gocryptfs flags:

| Value     | Flag       | What actually happens                                  |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `aes-gcm` | none       | reverse mode sets `AESSIV` anyway                      |
| `aes-siv` | `-aessiv`  | identical to the above, flag for flag                  |
| `xchacha` | `-xchacha` | `gocryptfs -reverse -init` exits 24, no config written |

Reverse mode needs deterministic encryption, so it enables the `AESSIV`
feature flag unconditionally. Verified on 2026-08-20 by initialising a reverse
config each way in `alpine:3.24` and reading `.FeatureFlags` out of
`.gocryptfs.reverse.conf`:

```text
aes-gcm (no flag)  ["HKDF","GCMIV128","DirIV","EMENames","LongNames","Raw64","AESSIV"]
aes-siv (-aessiv)  ["HKDF","GCMIV128","DirIV","EMENames","LongNames","Raw64","AESSIV"]
forward mode       ["HKDF","GCMIV128","DirIV","EMENames","LongNames","Raw64"]
```

`-xchacha` fails with "can't have both XChaCha20Poly1305 and AESSIV feature
flags" on both gocryptfs 2.5.4 (Alpine 3.23) and 2.6.1 (Alpine 3.24), so this
is long-standing and not a regression. The failure is at init only: a backup
that already has a config is unaffected.

So the setting offers a choice between two spellings of the same thing and one
that breaks. Options: drop `GOCRYPTFS_CIPHER` and document that reverse mode
implies AES-SIV; or keep it, reject `xchacha` up front with a clear message,
and say in `.env.example` that the other two are equivalent. Either is a
behaviour change to a documented option, so it wants its own pull request.

### 10. The Makefile expands env variables unquoted into positional arguments

**Status:** fixed. Every `${VAR}` expansion is now quoted at all eight call
sites that pass positional arguments to `backup.sh`, `restore.sh` and
`view.sh` (two, four and two respectively). `tests/test_makefile.py` blanks
`REMOTE_SERVER` and `GOCRYPTFS_CIPHER` in turn and drives `make --dry-run`
against each script, asserting both the argument count and the value in
every slot, so a blank value can no longer shift the arguments; the tests
were confirmed to fail against the unquoted Makefile before the fix.

Found while fixing item 9, and more dangerous than item 9 was.

`backup.sh` and its siblings take their configuration as positional arguments,
and the Makefile passes them like this:

```make
        /app/backup.sh \
            "/backup/src" \
            "/backup/enc" \
            ${REMOTE_SERVER_BACKUP_FOLDER} \
            "/backup/passfile" \
            ${REMOTE_SERVER} \
            ...
            ${GOCRYPTFS_CIPHER} \
            ${GOCRYPTFS_SCRYPT_N} \
            ${GOCRYPTFS_ENCRYPT_NAMES}
```

None of the variable expansions are quoted, so a blank value does not arrive as
an empty argument, it **disappears**, and every argument after it shifts down
one position. Blanking `GOCRYPTFS_CIPHER` in the env file therefore lands
`GOCRYPTFS_SCRYPT_N` in the cipher slot, `GOCRYPTFS_ENCRYPT_NAMES` in the
scrypt slot, and nothing in the eleventh, so `__gocryptfs_encrypt_names` takes
its `true` default.

That last part is the damaging one. `CLAUDE.md` records that
`GOCRYPTFS_ENCRYPT_NAMES` must be `false` for the rsync filter rules to match
anything, so a single blank line in the env file can silently flip filename
encryption on and defeat every exclude rule, on a run that otherwise looks
fine. `REMOTE_SERVER_BACKUP_FOLDER` and `REMOTE_SERVER` are unquoted too, so a
value containing a space splits instead of shifting.

Item 9's strict `*)` branch now catches the cipher slot specifically: a shifted
`16` is not a recognised cipher and aborts with a message that names this cause.
That is a backstop for one argument, not a fix.

The fix is to quote each expansion in the recipes, across every target that
invokes a script this way. Quoted and empty is correct: the scripts use
`${N:-default}`, which substitutes the default for an empty argument as well as
a missing one. Left for its own pull request because it touches several targets
and deserves a test that a blank env variable cannot shift anything.

## CodeRabbit: automatic reviews stop silently on a busy branch

`.coderabbit.yaml` now sets `reviews.auto_review.auto_pause_after_reviewed_commits: 0`.
That is a change from the default of `5`, which pauses automatic reviews once
five commits on a branch have been reviewed.

**Why it matters:** the pause is silent. The CodeRabbit check still reports
green, so a pull request looks reviewed when nothing has read its current
head. Observed directly on
[pre-commit-checklists#12](https://github.com/ivan-pinatti/pre-commit-checklists/pull/12),
a branch with seven commits: reviews stopped after the fifth, and twelve
hours passed with no review of the head and no indication anything was
waiting. Recovery needs a manual `@coderabbitai review`.

**Still open, and not fixable by config:** CodeRabbit's included-review quota
**drops** a review rather than queueing it. A push arriving while the quota is
exhausted is declined, and CodeRabbit does not retry it automatically; its
decline comment does name when the quota resets and invites a manual
re-request, so recovery is a deliberate step rather than a wait.

The quota is plan-specific and rolling rather than a documented constant, so
take the figure from CodeRabbit itself rather than from here: on 2026-08-18 it
reported "Your plan provides up to 3 included reviews per hour" on a **Pro
Plus** plan, in the same comment that declined the review. Its own message
names the remaining allowance and the reset time, which is the only
authoritative source.

No configuration helps. Checked
[`schema.v2.json`](https://storage.googleapis.com/coderabbit_public_assets/schema.v2.json)
as fetched on 2026-08-19: no retry, backoff, queue or poll setting exists
anywhere in it. The only recovery is a manual `@coderabbitai review`, or
`@coderabbitai full review` when the incremental logic has already marked the
commits as seen.

Worth knowing when judging whether a pull request is really reviewed:

- A green CodeRabbit **check** does not mean a review happened. It is green on
  a skipped draft and on a rate-limited decline.
- A **resolved** thread does not mean a fix was verified. CodeRabbit
  auto-resolves threads whose lines a later commit changed, which means the
  code moved, not that it was re-read.
- **Timestamps cannot answer this**, which this file used to claim they could.
  CodeRabbit edits its verdict comment in place, so `created_at` stays at the
  first review while `updated_at` moves for unrelated edits. See "Knowing
  whether CodeRabbit has actually reviewed a branch" in `CLAUDE.md` for the
  test that does work.

`drafts: false` is deliberate and stays. CodeRabbit is a GitHub App posting a
check, not a workflow job, so it cannot be ordered after the pre-commit job
with a `needs:` dependency. Skipping drafts is the lever instead: open as a
draft, let the pre-commit and test jobs run and report, fix whatever they find
and push, then mark the pull request ready once both pass. The checks
themselves change nothing in CI; the author does. The point is that a review
slot is spent on a diff that has already survived them, rather than on defects
a linter would have named for free.

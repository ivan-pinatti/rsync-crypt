## About

`rsync-crypt` is a Makefile-driven Docker tool that encrypts your local data on-the-fly using **gocryptfs reverse mode** and syncs only the encrypted copy to a remote server over SSH. The remote server never sees your plaintext files.

It supports:

- **User backup**: your home directory or any folder
- **Root backup**: system directories (`/etc`, `/home`, `/opt`, `/root`, `/srv`)
- **View mode**: browse the decrypted remote backup from any GUI file manager without pulling everything locally
- **Restore**: selective or full restore to a staging directory or back to origin

## How It Works

### Backup

```
Local data (plaintext)
        │
        ▼
gocryptfs -reverse     ← mounts a read-only virtual encrypted view (no files are modified)
        │
        ▼
Encrypted virtual dir  ← rsync reads this and transfers to the remote server over SSH
        │
        ▼
Remote server (encrypted files only, server never sees plaintext)
```

1. **gocryptfs** creates a virtual, read-only, encrypted view of your local data in reverse mode. Nothing on disk is touched.
2. **rsync** reads from that encrypted virtual directory and pushes it to the remote server over SSH.
3. The remote server receives only ciphertext. Without your passkey it is unreadable.

### View

```
Remote server (encrypted files)
        │
        ▼
sshfs               ← mounts remote folder inside the container (no full local copy)
        │
        ▼
gocryptfs -ro       ← decrypts the sshfs mount into a read-only virtual view
        │
        ▼
sshd (SFTP)         ← serves the decrypted view on 127.0.0.1:2222
        │
        ▼
Your file manager   ← connects via sftp://root@localhost:2222/gocrypt-view/decrypted
```

The view is **read-only** and **never writes plaintext to disk**. The SFTP port is bound to localhost only, it is not reachable from the network.

### Filter Rules

Edit `conf/backup-filter-rules.txt` to control what gets backed up. The file uses rsync filter rule syntax (`+` to include, `-` to exclude).

The default rules back up:

- **Chromium-based browsers** (Brave, Chrome, Chromium): bookmarks, preferences, extensions
- **Firefox**: bookmarks, preferences, extensions, passwords, certificates
- **Tor Browser**: profile data (bookmarks, prefs, extensions, certificates), excluding the browser binary and cache
- **VSCode**: user settings, keybindings, snippets, profiles
- **Lens Desktop**: cluster configs and settings
- **Spotify**: user preferences only (cached tracks are excluded)

Common exclusions by default: `.cache`, Trash, Docker local data, Flatpak data, `.asdf`, Minikube, Steam, Terraform providers.

> **Tip:** The filter file is well commented. Uncomment optional lines to also back up browser history, cookies, session data, or VSCode extensions.

> **Important:** Filter rules only work when `GOCRYPTFS_ENCRYPT_NAMES=false` (the default). When filename scrambling is enabled, rsync operates on the encrypted virtual directory and sees only ciphertext names, so no pattern in the filter file can match them. See [Known Issues](#known-issues-and-limitations) for details.

## Security and Key Management

### Files Created on First Run

On the first `make backup`, three key files are created:

| File                  | Default location                                         | Created by                         | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Passphrase file       | `GOCRYPTFS_PASSKEY_FILE` (set in `.env`)                 | `make backup` (interactive prompt) | Encryption passphrase, required for every operation    |
| gocryptfs config      | `$BACKUP_SOURCE_FOLDER/.gocryptfs.reverse.conf`          | gocryptfs                          | Encryption parameters (cipher, scrypt cost, name mode) |
| Config reference copy | `$BACKUP_SOURCE_FOLDER/.gocryptfs.reverse.conf.original` | `backup.sh`                        | Canonical config; restored before every run            |

> **Root backup:** the config is stored at the path set in `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_CONF` instead of inside `BACKUP_SOURCE_FOLDER`.

### The Passphrase File

`GOCRYPTFS_PASSKEY_FILE` is a plain text file containing your encryption passphrase.

- If the file does not exist when you run `make backup`, you are prompted to type a passphrase and the file is created automatically
- Permissions are set to `600` automatically
- Required for every backup, view, and restore operation
- Do not delete it unless you have the master key safely recorded somewhere else

**Prefer never writing the passphrase to disk?** Set `PARANOID_MODE=true` in your `.env`. The passkey file is completely bypassed: `check-passkey` is skipped, no volume is mounted into the container, and gocryptfs will prompt you to type the passphrase interactively at startup. Note that this mode requires an interactive terminal and cannot be used with cron or other non-interactive schedulers.

### The Master Key

During the first `gocryptfs -reverse -init`, gocryptfs generates a random master key and prints it to the terminal. The script pauses with a "Press O" prompt so you can write it down.

> **The master key is never written to disk. It is printed once and never again.**

Store it off-machine, separate from the backup destination:

- A password manager entry
- An offline or encrypted USB drive
- Paper in a physically secure location

**If you lose the passphrase file and do not have the master key, the encrypted backup is permanently unrecoverable.**

With the master key you can still access the backup even without the passphrase file:

```bash
gocryptfs -masterkey <your-master-key> ...
```

### The Config File

`.gocryptfs.reverse.conf` stores the encryption parameters set at init time: cipher, scrypt cost, and whether filenames are encrypted. It does not contain the encryption key itself.

The `.original` copy is the canonical reference. Before every run, `backup.sh` copies it back to `.gocryptfs.reverse.conf` to ensure the config stays consistent. Do not delete the `.original` file.

Back up the `.original` file alongside your passphrase (or passphrase file) to a second location off-machine.

### Recovery Scenarios

| Situation                                  | Recovery                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Passphrase file lost, master key available | Use `gocryptfs -masterkey <key>` to access the backup                      |
| Passphrase file lost, no master key        | Backup is permanently unrecoverable                                        |
| `.gocryptfs.reverse.conf` missing          | Restored automatically from `.gocryptfs.reverse.conf.original` on next run |
| `.gocryptfs.reverse.conf.original` missing | Restore from your off-machine backup of the config file                    |

### What `make clean` Removes

`make clean` permanently deletes:

- The passphrase file (`GOCRYPTFS_PASSKEY_FILE`)
- Both `.gocryptfs.reverse.conf` files from `BACKUP_SOURCE_FOLDER`
- The Docker image

After `make clean`, the next `make backup` re-initialises gocryptfs with a new master key. **The previous backup on the remote server remains intact and can still be read using the original passphrase or master key**, but the fresh local init produces a new config that is incompatible with the existing remote backup until a full re-sync completes.

## Usage

### Build

Build the Docker image (required once, or after any `Dockerfile` change):

```bash
make build
```

---

### Backup

#### User Backup

Backs up `BACKUP_SOURCE_FOLDER` (your home directory or any folder) to the remote server, encrypted.

```bash
make backup
```

On the **first run**, gocryptfs initialises the encrypted view, saves its config to `BACKUP_SOURCE_FOLDER`, and prints the **master key** to the terminal. The script pauses so you can write it down before continuing. See [Security and Key Management](#security-and-key-management) for a full description of what is created and what to back up off-machine.

If `GOCRYPTFS_PASSKEY_FILE` does not exist, you are prompted for a passphrase and the file is created automatically at that path.

rsync will keep running (retrying on failure) until a full sync completes. Subsequent runs are **incremental**, only changed files are transferred.

#### Root Backup (System Files)

Backs up `/etc`, `/home`, `/opt`, `/root`, and `/srv` as root, encrypted.

```bash
make backup_as_root
```

This is useful for backing up system-wide configuration alongside your user data.

#### Combined Build + Backup

```bash
make bb     # build + user backup
make bbr    # build + root backup
```

#### Bandwidth Limiting

Set `RSYNC_RATE_LIMIT` in `.env` (kbytes/s) or override at runtime:

```bash
RSYNC_RATE_LIMIT=5000 make backup   # limit to ~5 MB/s
```

---

### View

The view mode lets you **browse the decrypted remote backup from any GUI file manager** without downloading the full backup locally. It is read-only and safe.

```bash
make view           # browse user backup
make view_as_root   # browse root/system backup
```

What happens:

1. `sshfs` mounts the remote encrypted folder directly into the container (no local copy)
2. `gocryptfs` decrypts it into a read-only virtual mount inside the container
3. An SFTP server starts inside the container, available at `127.0.0.1:2222`
4. Your terminal shows the SFTP address and waits, press `Enter` to unmount and exit

#### Connecting Your File Manager

Once `make view` is running, open your file manager and connect to:

```
sftp://root@localhost:2222/gocrypt-view/decrypted
```

| File Manager           | How to connect                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| GNOME Files / Nautilus | Other Locations, Connect to Server |
| Thunar                 | Go, Open Location                  |
| Dolphin                | Network, Add Network Folder        |
| Any SFTP client        | `sftp root@localhost -p 2222`      |

> **Security note:** The SFTP port is bound to `127.0.0.1` only, it is not reachable from the network. Authentication uses your existing SSH key, no password is required.

When you are done browsing, press **Enter** in the terminal. The view will unmount cleanly and the container exits.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Filter Rules Are Incompatible with Filename Encryption

Setting `GOCRYPTFS_ENCRYPT_NAMES=true` causes rsync filter rules to stop working entirely.

**Why:** In gocryptfs reverse mode, the encrypted virtual directory (the one rsync reads from) contains scrambled filenames and directory names. A path like `.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Default/Bookmarks` becomes something like `gCqj/UKVCWfRmkXfp/nLpFwA==`. The rsync filter rules in `conf/backup-filter-rules.txt` match on human-readable paths, so no rule can ever match a scrambled name. The result is that rsync sees the entire encrypted directory as-is, ignores all filter rules, and transfers everything, including directories you intended to exclude.

**Current default:** `GOCRYPTFS_ENCRYPT_NAMES=false`. File and directory **contents** are still fully encrypted by gocryptfs; only the names and paths are stored in plaintext on the remote server. For most home backup scenarios this is an acceptable trade-off: the remote server can see your directory structure (revealing which applications you use) but cannot read any file content without your passphrase.

**Why not use gocryptfs's own exclude flags?** gocryptfs reverse mode does support `-exclude-wildcard` with gitignore-style negation patterns (e.g., `-exclude-wildcard '*' -exclude-wildcard '!/important'`), which operate on plaintext paths before encryption. However, the rsync filter syntax used in this project (specifically the include-first, catch-all-exclude pattern used in the browser and Firefox sections) cannot be expressed with exclusion-only patterns alone. Supporting this properly would require replacing the rsync filter file with a gocryptfs-native exclude file and rearchitecting how filtering is wired through the tool. This is a planned improvement for a future version.

**If you want scrambled filenames today** and are willing to trade fine-grained filtering for privacy: set `GOCRYPTFS_ENCRYPT_NAMES=true` and simplify `conf/backup-filter-rules.txt` to keep only the top-level exclusion rules (the `- **/.cache`, `- .local/share/Trash/**`, etc. lines under "General exclusions"). Then pass a plain exclude list to gocryptfs's `-exclude-from` flag instead of rsync. This requires manual changes to `scripts/backup.sh` and is not currently supported out of the box.
